Need these to get assigned



I don't want to see the parent tasks as a dropdown. I just want to see them like available options to select. And once I select one. It will keep on showing me subtasks in the below row. Then sub-sub task. Until I stop it should keep on diplaying the subtasks. Once I move ahead. That is the level where task should get stored.



Before going ahead lets confirm something. Also can you make some interface to add new tasks from the web app inside the database. Also I should be able to edit or delete the data inside database. Also can i assign the priority to the tasks and modify them by having a simple chat inside the app. So that I can chnage the priority of tasks on the go.
